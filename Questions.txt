Questions for the client:

- Is the ratio for the different shapes (rectangle and circle) always the same or can
the user specify this? I.e. the user can either:
  * specify values for the ratios;
  * choose from a pre-defined list of ratios.
  In general: do the geometries have parameters that the user can set?

- Do the mixers have parameters themselves (such as the angle between the cross-section of
a kenics) that can(not) be adjusted by the user?
If so, what (data)types do these parameters have?

- For the sequence of (wall)movements, there could be an option added to "optimize" the
sequence that the user has added. For instance, if the user has entered the sequence
0.5 lower wall to the right, 0.5 lower wall to the right, this sequence is simplified/
optimized to "1.0 lower wall to the right".
Note that it is only possible to perform such an optimization if the sequence involves
subsequent items with the same wall AND the same wall movement.

- When we receive a response from the server, will we only receive the end result of
applying the whole protocol (with the defined steps)? I.e., if the user defines that
the protocol should be applied 5 times, we will only receive the protocol applied 5 times.
Or do we receive the intermediate steps (after applying 1 time, again 1 time, etcetera)?

- The response we receive from the server involves a list of datapoints, describing the
mixing performance of the submitted information. It was already suggested that we could
use a log-plot (logarithmic values on the y-axis) for this, but do we receive the
logarithmic values from the server?

- Should the app (potentially) support multiple languages. That is, should the interface
be available in both Dutch and English for example?
