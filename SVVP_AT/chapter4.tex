For the tests to succeed, It is important that the tests are done in order. It is also important that the application is not closed between tests, unless the test states otherwise. Otherwise some steps done in earlier tests may have to be repeated for the latter tests to succeed. The set up required is described in appendix A\todo{add reference}.
