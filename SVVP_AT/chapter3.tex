This chapter gives a detailed description of all acceptance tests. These tests are strongly based on the use cases as described in Appendix B of the URD \cite{urd}. They cover all the user requirements from the URD \cite{urd}, except for the unimplemented and the untestable requirements.
The requirements that are not implemented in the \applicationname\ are \textbf{CPR4, CPR5, CPR14, CPR15, CPR16, CPR26, CPR27, CPR28, CPR38, CPR39 and CPR41}.

The requirement that cannot be tested is \textbf{CPR40}.

Before executing these tests, one should read and follow the guidelines as described in chapter \ref{chap:testProcedures} of this document.
