\begin{abstract}
This is the Acceptance Test Plan (ATP) of the \projectname{} project, developed in the context of
the Software Engineering Project (2IP35). This document contains a detailed specification for the Acceptance Tests (AT). These tests have to be executed by the client, prof.dr.ir. P.D. Anderson, to determine whether the delivered product meets the user requirements described in the User Requirements Document (URD). It also describes the environment needed to perform these tests. After a test has been performed, a report on the results needs to be written. If all tests pass, the acceptance test phase can be finished successfully.
This document complies with the Software Engineering Standard as specified by the European Space Agency (ESA) \cite{esa}.
