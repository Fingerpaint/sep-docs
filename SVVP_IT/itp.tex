This is the Integration Test Plan (ITP) of the \projectname{} project, developed in the context of
the Software Engineering Project (2IP35). This document contains a detailed specification for the Integration Tests (IT). These tests have to be executed during the Detailed Design (DD) phase of the \projectname{} project. It also describes the environment needed to perform these tests. After a test has been performed, a report on the results needs to be written.
This document complies with the Software Engineering Standard as specified by the European Space Agency (ESA) \cite{esa}.
