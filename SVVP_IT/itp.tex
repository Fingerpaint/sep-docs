% TODO: change this abstract to a one that fits the ITP.
This is the Integration Test Plan (ITP) of the \projectname{} project, developed in the context of
the Software Engineering Project (2IP35). This document contains a detailed specification for the Integration Tests (IT). These tests have to be executed during the Detailed Design (DD) phase of the \projectname. It also describes the environment needed to perform these tests. After a test has been performed, a report on the results needs to be written.
This document complies with the Software Engineering Standard as specified by the European Space Agency (ESA) \cite{esa}.
