\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}
This chapter lists general information about this document.

\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:purpose}
The Integration Test Plan (ITP) describes the plan for testing the integrated software against the architectural design, defined in the ADD \cite{add}. The integration tests make sure that
\projectname\ complies with the design in the Detailed Design (DD) phase of the \projectname{} project as described in the ESA Software Engineering Standard \cite{esa}.

\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}
Chapter 2 mentions the items to be tested together with the general criteria for the IT. A detailed specification for each test case is given in chapter 3. The procedures for the execution of the tests are explained in chapter 4. After execution of the tests, reports on the results will be presented in chapter 5.
