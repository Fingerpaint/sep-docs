\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}
This chapter explains the purpose of this document as well as what the scope of this document is, that is, how it is related to other documents in the project.

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to set rules and guidelines to which all project members should adhere. This concerns the versioning, identification and layout of all documents that are created for this project. All major documents should adhere to strict rules, while for other documents, such as files containing code, guidelines are set that are more loose.

This document should be read as a reference. It can be used when a developer or project member is not sure about how to do something as a mainstay.

\section{Scope}
In this project, the following configuration items (CIs) will be produced:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Architectural Design Document (ADD);
	\item Detailed Design Document (DDD);
	\item Software Configuration Management Plan (SCMP);
	\item Software Project Management Plan (SPMP);
	\item Software Quality Assurance Plan (SQAP);
	\item Software Requirements Document (SRD);
	\item Software Transfer Document (STD);
	\item Software User Manual (SUM);
	\item Software Verification and Validation Plan (SVVP);
	\item User Requirements Document (URD);
	\item Code;
	\item Test plans for a number of phases. In particular:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unit Test Plan (UTP);
		\item Integration Test Plan (ITP);
		\item Acceptance Test Plan (ATP).
	\end{itemize}
	\item Product Backlog.
\end{itemize}
The ESA standard mentions a System Test Plan (STP) as well, but in our case this can be omitted.
