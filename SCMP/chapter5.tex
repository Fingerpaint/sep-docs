\chapter{Status Accounting}
\label{chap:statusaccounting}
In this chapter, we discuss how the configuration status of CIs is documented and reported in a clear way to group members and management.

As described in chapter \ref{chap:configurationcontrol}, there are three libraries in which a CI can reside. The CM is responsible for moving files from one library to another, thereby following strict rules. To report the status of all CIs, the CM will maintain a page on the website of the \applicationname{}. This page will list all CIs and for every CI a table indicating its status. Such a status could look as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}cccl@{}}
	\toprule
	\emph{Version} & \emph{Library} & \emph{Date into master} & \emph{Comments} \\
	\midrule
	current & Development &           - & - \\
	0.3     & Master      & 07-May-2013 & - \\
	0.2     & Archive     & 03-May-2013 & - \\
	0.1     & Archive     & 25-Apr-2013 & - \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent Note here that the top line will always be present, even when for instance in above example, the current version is version 0.3. This is because changes in the development library are not tracked, but we want to make it explicit that there is a version sitting there, for completeness.
