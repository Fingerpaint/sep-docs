\chapter{Status Accounting}
\label{chap:statusaccounting}
In this chapter, we will discuss how the configuration status of CIs is documented and reported in a clear way to group members and management.

As described in chapter \ref{chap:configurationcontrol}, there are three libraries in which a CI can reside. The CM is responsible for moving files from one library to another, thereby following strict rules. To report the status of all CIs, the CM will maintain a page on the website of the \applicationname{}. This page will list all CIs and for every CI a table indicating its status. Such a status could look as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{@{}cccl@{}}
	\toprule
	\emph{Version} & \emph{Library} & \emph{Date into master} & \emph{Comments} \\
	\midrule
	current & Development &           - & - \\
	0.3     & Master      & 07-May-2013 & - \\
	0.2     & Archive     & 03-May-2013 & - \\
	0.1     & Archive     & 25-Apr-2013 & - \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent Note here that the top line will always be present, even when for instance in above example, the current version is version 0.3.
