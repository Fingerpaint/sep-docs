\section*{Define the geometry of the canvas}
\begin{tabular}{ll}

 Goals: & Define a mixing geometry \\
 Preconditions: & none \\
 Summary: & The user selects the geometry used for the mixing process \\
 Priority: & could have \\
 Steps: & \\
\end{tabular} \\
\ \\ \ \\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 User                       & FingerPaint                            \\
 1. Click on 'start mixing' & 2. Display select menu                 \\
 3. Select mixing geometry  & 4. Display blank initial distribution. \\
\end{tabular}

\section*{define the initial distribution}
\begin{tabular}{ll}

 Goals: & Define the starting distribution \\
 Preconditions: & the mixer geometry has been chosen \\
 Summary: & The user selects the initial distribution used for the mixing process \\
 Priority: & must have \\
 Steps: & \\
\end{tabular} \\
\ \\ \ \\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 User                       & FingerPaint                            \\
 1. Selects the color picker & 2. Opens a drop down menu with colors \\
 3. Selects a new color from a color picker & 4. Changes displayed color to the chosen color \\
 5. Makes an initial distribution for this color with the cursor (finger)  & 6. Fills in the area the cursor moves over with the selected color \\
 7. Repeat steps 3 \& 5 with different colors until satisfied & repeat steps 4 \& 6 accordingly \\
\end{tabular}

\section*{Define the mixing protocol}
\begin{tabular}{ll}

 Goals: & Define the desired sequence of mixing steps \\
 Preconditions: & an initial fluid distribution has been chosen \\
 Summary: & The user composes a sequence of steps that define a mixing protocol \\
 Priority: & must have \\
 Steps: & \\
\end{tabular} \\
\ \\ \ \\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 User                       & FingerPaint                            \\
 1. Selects a step size signifying how much the component moves & 2. Gives visual feedback on the selected value \\
 3. Selects a direction for a certain geometric component & 4. Calculates \& shows resulting fluid distribution of applying the given movement for the given step size \\
 5. Repeat steps 1 \& 3 until satisfied & 6. repeat 2 \& 4 accordingly \\
\end{tabular}
