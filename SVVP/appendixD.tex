\section{The Transition Review}

The outputs of the Transition Phase are formally reviewed in the Transition Review (T-R). Any report by the QAM may also be input for the T-R. Internal reviews are held  before the formal external T-R takes place. It ensures that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The SUM explains what the software does and instructs the users how to operate the software correctly.
\item The STD describes the procedures needed to transfer the product to the client.
\end{itemize}
