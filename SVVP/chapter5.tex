\chapter{Verification reporting}
    For the verification and validation of technical CIs (apart from the URD \cite{urd}) two parts are
    added to these CIs:
\begin{itemize}
\item A verification report
\item A validation report
\end{itemize}
    These reports are presented to and checked by a member of the SQA team. The people
    performing the test of the CI write the verification report. The people who delivered the CI
    write the validation report. These are both checked when the CI is reviewed. A validation
    report is written as a result of the tracing. It contains a traceability table. A verification
    report is written as a result of a test. It contains the following items:
\begin{itemize}
\item Unique reference number of the test plan
\item Problems discovered and, if available, solutions to these
\item Acceptance or disapproval of the CI. In case of disapproval, accompanied with a short explanation of the reasons of disapproval
\end{itemize}
For the verification and validation of the entire \projectname{} project, progress meetings are held with the SM according to the SPMP \cite{spmp}.
