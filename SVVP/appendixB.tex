\section{The User Requirements Review}
The outputs of the User Requirements Definition Phase are formally internally and externally reviewed in the User Requirements Review (UR/R). It ensures that the URD/Product Backlog states the user requirements clearly and completely and a general description of the processes to be supported (the environment) is present. The SPMP, SCMP, SVVP and SQAP are only internally reviewed.

\section{Requirements for user requirements}
User requirements (written as stories) should be realistic, that is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clear.
\item Verifiable.\\
	``The product shall be user friendly'' is not verifiable.
\item Complete.
\item Accurate.\\
          Among other things, the URD/Product Backlog is inaccurate if it requests something that the user does not
          need, for example a superfluous capacity.
\item Feasible.
\item Traceable, i.e. every requirement should have an unique identifier.
\end{itemize}
