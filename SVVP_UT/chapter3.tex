\chapter{Test case specifications}\label{chap:testcasespec}
The specifications for the test cases can be found in the source code repository, more specifically in the \texttt{fingerpaint/application/test/src/nl/tue/fingerpaint/} folder. % This folder contains two subfolders, namely \texttt{client} and \texttt{server}. The \texttt{server} folder contains tests concerning the communication between the client and server, while the \texttt{client} folder contains tests that are only applicable to the client.
To read the explanation of a test case -- i.e. what it does and what it checks -- refer to the Javadoc for that test.
