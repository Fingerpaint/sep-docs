This document is the Unit Test Plan (UTP) of \projectauthor{}. This project is part of the
Software Engineering Project (2IP35) and is one of the assignments at Eindhoven University of Technology. The document complies with the UTP from the Software Engineering
Standard, as set by the European Space Agency \cite{esa}.
This document provides the main guidance for the Unit Test (UT) during the Detailed
Design (DD) phase for the \projectname{} application. It describes the environment needed to
perform the UT. When this environment is set up, all test cases must be executed according
to their corresponding test procedures. After a test has been performed a report needs to
