\begin{abstract}
This document is the Unit Test Plan (UTP) of \projectauthor{}. This project is part of the
Software Engineering Project (2IP35) and is one of the assignments at Eindhoven University of Technology. The document complies with the UTP from the Software Engineering Standard, as set by the European Space Agency \cite{esa}.
The UTP provides the main guidance for the Unit Tests (UT) during the Detailed Design (DD) phase for the \projectname{} application. It describes the environment needed to perform the UT. When this environment is set up, all test cases must be executed according to their corresponding test procedures. After a test has been performed a report will be written.
