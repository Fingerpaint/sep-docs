General Remark & Other & There was already a LaTeX template available for SCMP; perhaps you can check whether you conformed to the template. Another possibility is to merge the pieces you have with the text that is provided in the template. \\
Abstract & Missing & The reference to the ESA document doesn't work/is missing. As a consequence, all references mentioned in the document are broken/missing. \\

1.3	 & Incorrect & 2IP35 is the Software Engineering Project, not a Course. \\
1.3	 & Other & You don't have to translate BCF: its English equivalent meaning is namely ``Bureau for Computer Facilities". \\

2.1 & Missing	 & 	Here, you refer to the SPMP, but there is no reference to this external document. \\
2.3	 & 	Missing	 & Again, you mention the SPMP, but there is no reference. \\
2.5	 & 	Question & Is it an idea to make a small figure that summarizes what you say in this paragraph, so people can immediately say what the required structure of the documents is? \\
2.5	 & Missing & The template describes that all documents must also adhere to the requirements in SQAP and SVVP. \\

3.1 & Style & The writing style of this section is a bit informal, in my opinion, especially the sentence ``note how exception this situation sounds". It is a formal document, so a formal writing style is appropriate here. \\
3.1 & Typo & ``Et cetera" should be ``etcetera", I think. \\

4 & Style & ``Since we are at it" sounds a bit informal to me. Perhaps you can change it to, "Moreover, we will describe ..." \\
4.1 & Style	 & In the sentence ``We call a place where CIs are stored a library", I would place library between quotes, as you introduce it as a new term here. \\
4.1.1 & Style & In project-docs, in the sentence ``That is, all CIs that ... are stored here" I would place an additional comma somewhere, to make it more readable. It is now unclear to me what the ``leading to the creation of that application"-part refers to. \\
4.1.1 & Style & In sep-docs, I would start the second sentence with ``This" instead of ``That": often ``that" is used in the same sentence, whereas ``this" is more appropriate in a new sentence, I think. \\
4.1.3 & Question & The purpose of the sentence ``Of course, the difference is clearly stated on the website" is not clear to me. Do we have to mention explicitely that the difference is explained on the website? Now, it appears that the focus lies on the fact that the difference is stored on the website, whereas you actually just want to say that there is a difference, I think. \\
4.1.3 & Missing & The template mentions again SQAP and SVVP, but there are not mentioned in this section. \\
4.3.2 & Missing	 & You mention the SVVP document, but there is no reference to it. \\
4.3.3 & Missing & The template mentions SVVP, but there is no reference to that document in this subsection. \\
4.3.3 & Style & The sentence ``Note that files ... been approved externally" is a bit long, perhaps you can split it in multiple sentences? \\

6.1.3 & Question & Is it really the case that GWT provides only two things? Or does it provide many things and are we only going to use those specific two things? \\
6.1.3 & Typo & In the sentence ``Finally, the GWT includes a plugin..", ``plugin" should be ``plug-in". \\
6.1.4  & Other & You have two sentences that start with ``Of course". This reads a bit odd and I think you actually mean to say ``However" in the second sentence. \\
6.1.4 & Other & It seems a bit strange to start a sentence with ``Still then", perhaps you can suffice with ``Still". \\
6.1.6 & Style & The style of the sentence ``if the server .., which we have done" is again a bit informal. Perhaps you can simply remove the ``which we have done" part, or you can re-phrase it in a different way. \\
6.1.7 & Question & I understand that we use LaTeX because of the good-looking documents, but is that really a key motivation to use LaTeX? \\
6.2.1 & Style & Again, beware of the informal style: it is a formal document, after all.
