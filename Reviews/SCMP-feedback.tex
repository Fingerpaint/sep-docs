General Remark & Other & There was already a LaTeX template available for SCMP; perhaps you can check whether you conformed to the template. Another possibility is to merge the pieces you have with the text that is provided in the template. \\
Abstract & Missing & The reference to the ESA document doesn't work/is missing. As a consequence, all references mentioned in the document are broken/missing. \\

1.3	 & Incorrect & 2IP35 is the Software Engineering Project, not a Course. \\

1 & Other & The introduction is in future tense, while it should be present tense.\\
1 & Other & The introduction is strangely constructed, and the second sentence should be a subsentence of the first.\\
1.1 & Other & Second sentence contains future tense again.\\
1.4 & Missing & References are empty, and in turn all references show as ``[?]''.\\

2.1 & Missing	 & 	Here, you refer to the SPMP, but there is no reference to this external document. \\
2.3	 & 	Missing	 & Again, you mention the SPMP, but there is no reference. \\
2.5	 & 	Question & Is it an idea to make a small figure that summarizes what you say in this paragraph, so people can immediately say what the required structure of the documents is? \\
2.5	 & Missing & The template describes that all documents must also adhere to the requirements in SQAP and SVVP. \\

2 & Other & First sentence of \emph{Management} is passive, but it could easily be changed to active form.\\
2.2 & Missing & Master and archive libraries are introduced, but they are never explained. Only in Section 3.1 is it mentioned that these will be described in Chapter 4.\\
2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2 & Typo & ``chapter'', ``section'' etc. should be capitalised.\\

3.1 & Style & The writing style of this section is a bit informal, in my opinion, especially the sentence ``note how exception this situation sounds". It is a formal document, so a formal writing style is appropriate here. \\
3.1 & Typo & ``Et cetera" should be ``etcetera", I think. \\

4 & Style & ``Since we are at it" sounds a bit informal to me. Perhaps you can change it to, "Moreover, we will describe ..." \\
4.1 & Style	 & In the sentence ``We call a place where CIs are stored a library", I would place library between quotes, as you introduce it as a new term here. \\
4.1.1 & Style & In project-docs, in the sentence ``That is, all CIs that ... are stored here" I would place an additional comma somewhere, to make it more readable. It is now unclear to me what the ``leading to the creation of that application"-part refers to. \\
4.1.1 & Style & In sep-docs, I would start the second sentence with ``This" instead of ``That": often ``that" is used in the same sentence, whereas ``this" is more appropriate in a new sentence, I think. \\
4.1.3 & Question & The purpose of the sentence ``Of course, the difference is clearly stated on the website" is not clear to me. Do we have to mention explicitely that the difference is explained on the website? Now, it appears that the focus lies on the fact that the difference is stored on the website, whereas you actually just want to say that there is a difference, I think. \\
4.1.3 & Missing & The template mentions again SQAP and SVVP, but there are not mentioned in this section. \\
4.3.2 & Missing	 & You mention the SVVP document, but there is no reference to it. \\
4.3.3 & Missing & The template mentions SVVP, but there is no reference to that document in this subsection. \\
4.3.3 & Style & The sentence ``Note that files ... been approved externally" is a bit long, perhaps you can split it in multiple sentences? \\

4, 4.1.1 & Other & Future tense.\\
4.1.1 & Other & It says that documents that are stored are stored in \emph{The development library will store all versions of a CI that are stored in it}. I get what is meant, but it does sound strange.\\
4.1.1 & Other & \emph{made undone} should be \emph{undone}.\\
4.1.1 & Other & \emph{(Git is discussed in more detail in chapter 6)} can be a main sentence instead of a subsentence.\\
4.1.1 & Other & \emph{all CIs are stored here that are related to the Fingerpaint application and not to the SEP that led to the creation of that application} should be \emph{all CIs that are related to the Fingerpaint application and not to the SEP that led to the creation of that application are stored here}.

6.1.3 & Question & Is it really the case that GWT provides only two things? Or does it provide many things and are we only going to use those specific two things? \\
6.1.3 & Typo & In the sentence ``Finally, the GWT includes a plugin..", ``plugin" should be ``plug-in". \\
6.1.4  & Other & You have two sentences that start with ``Of course". This reads a bit odd and I think you actually mean to say ``However" in the second sentence. \\
6.1.4 & Other & It seems a bit strange to start a sentence with ``Still then", perhaps you can suffice with ``Still". \\
6.1.6 & Style & The style of the sentence ``if the server .., which we have done" is again a bit informal. Perhaps you can simply remove the ``which we have done" part, or you can re-phrase it in a different way. \\
6.1.7 & Question & I understand that we use LaTeX because of the good-looking documents, but is that really a key motivation to use LaTeX? \\
6.2.1 & Style & Again, beware of the informal style: it is a formal document, after all.

6.1 & Incorrect & Saying that \emph{we will be able to do anything the client wants} is a very strong statement.\\
6.1 & Other & Second paragraph: lots of future tense.\\
6.1.1 & Typo & Superfluous comma in \emph{Git is a distributed, lightweight, version control system}.\\
6.1.1 & Typo & In \emph{GitHub is a (commercial) servers}, servers should probably be service.\\
6.1.3 & Other & In my opinion, writing JavaScript instead of JS looks better.\\
6.1.3 & Missing & The five most widely used browsers are mentioned, but not named.\\
6.1.4 & Other & Like it is written now, \emph{It is simply impossible to test both browsers on \ldots} implies that there are only two browsers.\\
6.1.4 & Other & \emph{It is multilingual, including Java, which is our choice} is a strange fragmented sentence.\\
6.2.1 & Other & The colon in \emph{\ldots so the conventions are simple: a developer does not want to do something complex a lot} implies that ``the conventions are simple, namely a developer \ldots''.\\
