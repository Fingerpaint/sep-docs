1.2 & Question & You mention that our application provides an interface for an already defined mixing program, but do you suggest here that we are the ones that made that mixing program? Now, it looks like we developed this program, whereas actually our application only visualizes the results of this ``already defined mixing program". Only at the end of this paragraph, you mention that the calculation is done elsewhere. Perhaps you can mention this earlier in this section. \\
1.2 & Missing &The part of the sentence ``The second goal is" suggests that there is some enumeration. However, there is no ``first goal". \\
1.3 & Incorrect & 2IP35 is not a course, but a project. \\
