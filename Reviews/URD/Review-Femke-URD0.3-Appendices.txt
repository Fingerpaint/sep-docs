Review about: use cases

Location/ref 			Category		Remark
-----------------------------------------------------
Appendix A				Typo			"use-cases" should be "use cases".
Appendix A				Missing			Perhaps explain what the "Preceeds"  and Uses relationships means, although we know what this means, the client might not.

Figure 2.1				Question		What are those use cases listed above the diagram? Do they have no relations to other use cases? Maybe you can clarify this a bit.
Figure 2.1				Missing			In the use case B.8, you mention B.4, B.5, B.6 or B.7 as actor actions that have been taken earlier. In the use case diagram, however, there is no direct arrow between B.4 (define an initial distr.) and B.8.
Figure 2.1				Question		Is it an idea to also include the IDs (B.x) in the use case diagram? I think this might clarify things even more.
Figure 2.1				Inconsistent	Use case B.20 is called "Remove concentration distribution", but the use case listed in figure 2.1 says "remove initial concentration distribution"
