Review of URD0.3
Reviewer: Tessa Belder

Chapter 1:
Category	Location			Remark
--------------------------------------------------------
Typo		1.2 Scope			'developed by Group Fingerpaint group' --> 2x 'group'.
Incorrect	1.2 Scope			'Users can define the initial concentration' should be 'can define the initial concentration distribution'.
Missing		1.3.1. Definitions		'iPhone' should be added here, since it is used in section 2.2.2.
Other		1.3.2. Abbreviations		'TBC' and 'TBD' can be removed from this list, as they aren't used in this document.
Missing		1.3.2. Abbreviations		'PC' shoudl be added here, since it is used in section 2.2.2.
Missing		1.5 Overview			The appendices aren't mentioned here, and they should be.

Chapter 2:
Category	Location			Remark
--------------------------------------------------------
Incorrect	2.1 Product Perspective		'to compute the flow of the fluids' --> The server doesn't compute the flow, it computes the new concentration distribution.
Incorrect	2.1 Product Perspective		'for the flow of the fluids' --> Again, not the flow of the fluids, just the resulting concentration distribution.
Incorrect	2.1 Product Perspective		'can compute the flow of the fluids' --> The same as above.
Incorrect	2.2 General Capabilities	'able to compute the flow of the fluids' --> Same as above.
Incorrect	2.2.1 Mixing Constraints	'The fourth constraint is the initial concentration of the fluids' --> Shoudl be 'initial concentration distribution of the fluids'
Incorrect	2.2.2. Additional capabilities	'the computation of the flow' --> Should be 'the computation of the new concentration distribution'.
Incorrect	2.2.2. Additional capabilities	'via a two-dimensional image of the fluid distribution' should be 'of the fluid concentration distribution'.
Incorrect	2.2.2. Additional capabilities	'It should also be possible to save entire runs as an animations'--> this is a 'could' and not a 'should'.
Incorrect	2.2.2. Additional capabilities	'or to start over with the original distribution' --> Actually this is not always possible; you can reset it to an entire white distribution, or, if you've saved the original one, you can load it again.

Incorrect	2.3 General constraints		'to quickly try out new ideas for mixers' --> You can't try a new mixer, you can try new protocols / new initial concentration distribution.

Incorrect	2.3 General constraints		'the server can compute the flow of fluids' --> Same mistake again.
Incorrect	2.3 General constraints		'when the flow has been computed' --> Again, flow isn't computed.
Incorrect	2.3 General constraints		'As mentioned before, it should be possible... ...and the resulting performance metric' --> You can't export mixing runs, you can only save them within the application. You can only export 2the image of the final concentration distribution, the performance graph, and the animation of the mixing run.

Incorrect	2.4 User Characteristics	'to quickly try out ideas for mixers' --> Can't try out a new mixer, only new protocols / initial concentration distributions.
Incorrect	2.4 User Characteristics	'The user can change the shape and characterisitics of the mixer' --> Well maybe later, but these are options to be included later, not the main idea of the application.

Incorrect	2.5 Environment description	'The initial concentration of the fluids' --> initial concentration distribution.
Incorrect	2.5 Environment description	flow is mentioned multiple times in this section, same comment as before.
Incorrect	2.5 Environment description	Figure 2.1: arrows 3, 4 and 5 talk about flow, should be concentration distribution.
Incorrect	2.6 Assumptions			Second assumption talks about flow. Again not correct.
