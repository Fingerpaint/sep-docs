2.1 & Inconsistent & In this paragraph you talk about mobile devices, while it should be cross-platform. \\
2.1 & Other & The sentence ``after which output should be shown on the screen'' is unclear and ambiguous. \\
2.1 & Other & You talk about sending constraints to the server as a black box, but I think there's too much detail about the black box and how it will work. Just say it is present and you leave the complicated computations to them and you do the visualizing and formatting. \\
2.2.1 & Incorrect & The system should not be able to simulate the flow, as you just said that you leave the computations to the server. You will only visualise the results of these computations. \\
2.2.1 & Other & The sentences ``given some constraints. There are a number of constraints to be specified'' are redundant, as you already said that there are some constraints in the first sentence. \\
2.2.1 & Other & The sentence ``can be specified by tapping on and dragging over the screen'' is unclear and ambiguous. What you're actually doing is making an app that can specify these constraints (it should be noted somewhere before additional capabilities). \\
2.2.2 & Missing & From the sentence ``When the initial parameters have been set, the computations are offloaded to a server'' it is not clear what your capabilities are. Your capability is sending these to the server and retrieving results. \\
2.2.2 & Other & ``should be exportable to ... .png or .pdf'' is very specific. Maybe there's a better way you didn't think of yet. Here you should probably say: "We need to be able to export it to a standardised animated format (solution space rather than problem space). \\
2.2.2 & Missing & It is in general not clear that we can actually visualise the returned results.\\
2.3 & Other & You use a lot of pretty words and long sentences, but actually you're not really saying what you want to say. For instance, just say that you assume that the server computation does not take too long and thus visualisation can be handled quickly.  That clarifies things much more and the sentences also get shorter. \\
2.4 & Missing & This section is more for different stakeholders. Although in this case, I feel there is actually only one. Still, it might be beneficial to describe WHO your user is (in terms of position, not person) on top of what this person can do. \\
2.4 & Missing & In the sentence ``after the application has sent these off to the server, should be able to view the results'' it is unclear which results you're talking about. \\
2.5 & Question & You say ``intermediate results are sent back to the mobile device for displaying'', but is this really the case? Does the server not simply finish a step and then send it back, then calculate the next step? ``While solving, return some stuff'' is a bit vague. \\
2.5 & Missing & Maybe you can make one of those domain models, even though it will be small. \\
2.6 & Question & ``Therefore, we assume this server always answers within a few seconds'', but you should also have some basic error handling at least, right? I think it is not a good assumption that the server ALWAYS responds within a few seconds.  \\
2.6 & Missing & What about the assumption that the server in fact gives a correct solution? Or the assumption that the mobile device doesn't lose connection to the internet? \\

2.1 & Question & In the sentence ``we are to use it as a black box to which we can send constraints and a vector'', it is unclear what the vector is. Is this an implementation detail? If this is the case, it should not be mentioned in this document \\
2.2.1 & Question & What do you mean with the sentence ``It is possible to both specify ...''? Perhaps you can insert a few comma's in this sentence or you can re-write it to make it more clear. \\
2.2.2 & Missing & In the sentence ``A history of past simulations ... to compare previous runs with the current'', I would change ``current'' to ``current run'', because now it is unclear what ``current'' is.\\
2.3 & Inconsistent & ``The user interface ... without much hassle'' contains both present time and past time writing. Try to stick to writing in one particular time.\\
2.3 & Structure & In general, I see the word ``so'' quite often, but try to use some other words for ``so'' as well. \\
2.5 & Question & Where does ``parameters described above'' refer to? It doesn't appear to be in the previous paragraph in this section, so try to be more clear in which section you described these parameters. \\
2.6 & Typo & In ``As a mentioned'', ``a'' should be ``we'', I believe. \\
2.6 & Missing & In the sentence ``Therefore, we assume this server...'' I would add the word ``that'', to obtain the sentence ``Therefore, we assume that this server...''. \\

2.2 & Missing & The sentence ``The third parameter to be specified is '' is unfinished.\\
2.2.1 & Structure/Layout & The sentence ``It is possible to both specify an entire protocol consisting of multiple wall movements, and to only execute one step at a time.'' sounds like you can do two things at the same time. I would change it to: ``It is both possible to specify an entire protocol consisting of multiple wall movements, and to only execute one step at a time.'' \\
2.2.1 & Missing & There is no information included about the parameter '\#steps' which defines how many times the defined mixing protocol is executed. \\
2.2.1 & Incorrect & ``The fourth parameter is the initial concentration of the fluids,'' should be: ``The fourth parameter is the initial concentration distribution of the fluids,'' \\
2.2.1 & Missing & ``If desired, it is also possible to load an existing initial distribution." This should be "If desired, it is also possible to load an existing or predifined initial concentration distribution.''\\

2.1 & Incorrect & 'can compute the flow of the fluids' -- The same as above. \\
2.2 & Incorrect & 'able to compute the flow of the fluids' -- Same as above. \\
2.2.1 & Incorrect & 'The fourth constraint is the initial concentration of the fluids' -- Should be 'initial concentration distribution of the fluids'. \\

2.2.2 & Incorrect & 'via a two-dimensional image of the fluid distribution' should be 'of the fluid concentration distribution'.\\
2.2.2 & Incorrect & 'It should also be possible to save entire runs as an animations'--> this is a 'could' and not a 'should'. \\
2.2.2 & Incorrect & 'or to start over with the original distribution' --> Actually this is not always possible; you can reset it to an entire white
distribution, or, if you've saved the original one, you can load it again. \\
2.3 & Incorrect & 'to quickly try out new ideas for mixers' --> You can't try a new mixer, you can try new protocols / new initial concentration
distribution.\\
2.3 & Incorrect & 'the server can compute the flow of fluids' --> Same mistake again.\\
2.3 & Incorrect & 'when the flow has been computed' --> Again, flow isn't computed.\\
2.3 & Incorrect & 'As mentioned before, it should be possible... ...and the resulting performance metric' --> You can't export mixing runs, you can only save them within the application. You can only export the image of the final concentration distribution, the performance graph, and the animation of the mixing run.\\
2.4 & Incorrect & 'to quickly try out ideas for mixers' --> Can't try out a new mixer, only new protocols / initial concentration distributions.\\
2.4 & Incorrect & 'The user can change the shape and characterisitics of the mixer' --> Well maybe later, but these are options to be included later, not the main idea of the application.\\
2.5 & Incorrect & Figure 2.1: arrows 3, 4 and 5 talk about flow, should be concentration distribution.\\
2.5 & Incorrect & Second assumption talks about flow. Again not correct.\\

2.2 (description) & Missing & In this paragraph, the ``movement of the walls'' is mentioned, but we didn't mention the ``walls'' as a mixing protocol in earlier sections. Perhaps changing it to something like this will clarify it a bit more: ``.. given some constraints and initial concentration of the fluids. The constraints are described through a mixing protocol and consists of a sequence of transformations that are applied to the selected geometry. In case of a rectangular geometry, for instance, the sequence consists of 'wall movements': the fluid can be manipulated by moving an upper and lower wall for a specified amount of steps.''
\\
2.2 & Structure & I would explain the example as a new sentence, instead of placing it within brackets in the current sentence. In general, using long sentences within brackets can decrease the readability of the text.\\
2.3 & Missing & A third parameter is started to be explained, but the sentence is not finished.
``The third parameter ...'' \\
2.4 & Structure/Layout & I would change this to ``As mentioned before''. Now, it seems like the focus lies on the ``being documented'' part, whereas you probably only want to say that you mentioned this earlier in this chapter.\\

B.5, B.11, B.12, B.14, B.15, B.16 & Other & Why is a message shown when the save was successful? It would only be an annoying pop-up that the user would have to click away. I'd only show a message if the save was unsuccessful.\\
B.7 & Question & Is it possible that there are no saved protocols? I thought that either we would not implement this feature or the client would provide us with predefined protocols.\\
B.8 and others & Typo & Inconsistent spacing.\\
B.8 & Question & Remark is not clear.\\
B.9 & Other & Maybe refer to use cases by name, not just by section number.\\
B.10 & Question & What is the protocol-log?\\
\setVersion{0.5}
B.9 & Typo & protoco.l $\rightarrow$ protocol.\\
B.10 & Other & The \textbf{Alternative} of this use case is unclear: the numbering goes from 8 to 5 to 6, making it unclear when a failure to connect actually happens.\\
B.10 & Other & Forward reference to \textbf{Alternative R.2}. I was unable to find this alternative without using the search function, because I was expecting it to be somewhere in use cases B.1 until B.9. Also, I'm not sure whether this is the correct alternative.\\

Figure 2.1 & Question & What are those use cases listed above the diagram? Do they have no relations to other use cases? Maybe you can clarify this a bit. \\
Figure 2.1 & Missing &  In the use case B.8, you mention B.4, B.5, B.6 or B.7 as actor actions that have been taken earlier. In the use case diagram, however, there is no direct arrow between B.4 and B.8. \\
Figure 2.1 & Question & Is it an idea to also include the IDs (B.x) of the use cases in the use case diagram? I think this might clarify things even more.  \\
Figure 2.1 & Inconsistent & Use case B.20 is called ``remove concentration distribution", but the use case listed in figure 2.1 says ``remove initial concentration distribution" \\
