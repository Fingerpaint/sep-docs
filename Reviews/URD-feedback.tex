1.1 & Structure & You might consider rephrasing the sentence ``All of the listed requirements''. We just assure that some requirements will be implemented, but not all requirements. \\

abstract & missing & The abstract is very short and could use some more information; see the template for scmp.pdf as an example. You could mention in the abstract that this document is part of the SEP project and what can be found in this document (a very brief description). \vspace{1em} \\
1.1 & Structure & I would change the beginning to this sentence to ``This document'', because you already mentioned in the abstract that this document is the URD.\vspace{1em} \\
1.2 & Question & I believe that the client mentioned that the original goal was to find the optimal mix as soon as possible. Should we mention that here as well? \vspace{1em} \\

1.5 & Structure/layout & I would change the layout/text in the list to something like:

2.1 & Inconsistent & In this paragraph you talk about mobile devices, while it should be cross-platform. \\
2.1 & Other & The sentence ``after which output should be shown on the screen'' is unclear and ambiguous. \\
2.1 & Other & You talk about sending constraints to the server as a black box, but I think there's too much detail about the black box and how it will work. Just say it is present and you leave the complicated computations to them and you do the visualizing and formatting. \\
2.2.1 & Incorrect & The system should not be able to simulate the flow, as you just said that you leave the computations to the server. You will only visualise the results of these computations. \\
2.2.1 & Other & The sentences ``given some constraints. There are a number of constraints to be specified'' are redundant, as you already said that there are some constraints in the first sentence. \\
2.2.1 & Other & The sentence ``can be specified by tapping on and dragging over the screen'' is unclear and ambiguous. What you're actually doing is making an app that can specify these constraints (it should be noted somewhere before additional capabilities). \\
2.2.2 & Missing & From the sentence ``When the initial parameters have been set, the computations are offloaded to a server'' it is not clear what your capabilities are. Your capability is sending these to the server and retrieving results. \\
2.2.2 & Other & ``should be exportable to ... .png or .pdf'' is very specific. Maybe there's a better way you didn't think of yet. Here you should probably say: "We need to be able to export it to a standardised animated format (solution space rather than problem space). \\
2.2.2 & Missing & It is in general not clear that we can actually visualise the returned results.\\
2.3 & Other & You use a lot of pretty words and long sentences, but actually you're not really saying what you want to say. For instance, just say that you assume that the server computation does not take too long and thus visualisation can be handled quickly.  That clarifies things much more and the sentences also get shorter. \\
2.4 & Missing & This section is more for different stakeholders. Although in this case, I feel there is actually only one. Still, it might be beneficial to describe WHO your user is (in terms of position, not person) on top of what this person can do. \\
2.4 & Missing & In the sentence ``after the application has sent these off to the server, should be able to view the results'' it is unclear which results you're talking about. \\
2.5 & Question & You say ``intermediate results are sent back to the mobile device for displaying'', but is this really the case? Does the server not simply finish a step and then send it back, then calculate the next step? ``While solving, return some stuff'' is a bit vague. \\
2.5 & Missing & Maybe you can make one of those domain models, even though it will be small. \\
2.6 & Question & ``Therefore, we assume this server always answers within a few seconds'', but you should also have some basic error handling at least, right? I think it is not a good assumption that the server ALWAYS responds within a few seconds.  \\
2.6 & Missing & What about the assumption that the server in fact gives a correct solution? Or the assumption that the mobile device doesn't lose connection to the internet? \\

2.1 & Question & In the sentence ``we are to use it as a black box to which we can send constraints and a vector'', it is unclear what the vector is. Is this an implementation detail? If this is the case, it should not be mentioned in this document \\
2.2.1 & Question & What do you mean with the sentence ``It is possible to both specify ...''? Perhaps you can insert a few comma's in this sentence or you can re-write it to make it more clear. \\
2.2.2 & Missing & In the sentence ``A history of past simulations ... to compare previous runs with the current'', I would change ``current'' to ``current run'', because now it is unclear what ``current'' is.\\
2.3 & Inconsistent & ``The user interface ... without much hassle'' contains both present time and past time writing. Try to stick to writing in one particular time.\\
2.3 & Structure & In general, I see the word ``so'' quite often, but try to use some other words for ``so'' as well. \\
2.5 & Question & Where does ``parameters described above'' refer to? It doesn't appear to be in the previous paragraph in this section, so try to be more clear in which section you described these parameters. \\
2.6 & Typo & In ``As a mentioned'', ``a'' should be ``we'', I believe. \\
2.6 & Missing & In the sentence ``Therefore, we assume this server...'' I would add the word ``that'', to obtain the sentence ``Therefore, we assume that this server...''. \\

2.2 (description) & Missing & In this paragraph, the ``movement of the walls'' is mentioned, but we didn't mention the ``walls'' as a mixing protocol in earlier sections. Perhaps changing it to something like this will clarify it a bit more: ``.. given some constraints and initial concentration of the fluids. The constraints are described through a mixing protocol and consists of a sequence of transformations that are applied to the selected geometry. In case of a rectangular geometry, for instance, the sequence consists of 'wall movements': the fluid can be manipulated by moving an upper and lower wall for a specified amount of steps.''
\\
2.2 & Structure & I would explain the example as a new sentence, instead of placing it within brackets in the current sentence. In general, using long sentences within brackets can decrease the readability of the text.\\
2.3 & Missing & A third parameter is started to be explained, but the sentence is not finished.
``The third parameter ...'' \\
2.4 & Structure/Layout & I would change this to ``As mentioned before''. Now, it seems like the focus lies on the ``being documented'' part, whereas you probably only want to say that you mentioned this earlier in this chapter.\\

3 & Incorrect & The sentence ``any requirements following from further requests will be added here'' is not correct: we won't just add any requirements that are requested. Also, after signing the URD, there should not really be any more changes/additions. \\
3.1 & Structure & It might be nice to have more hierarchy for the requirements (as in the review checklist: coherent groups). \\
3.1 & Inconsistent & Formats are named in these constraints, while others are named in previous chapters (.SVG here, .GIF there). Try to make this consistent. \\
CPR03 \& CPR04 & Other & Maybe you can split these requirements, so you can always try to achieve one of them. \\
CPR06 \& CPR17 & Other & Why do you use a list? This seems like a solution space instead of a problem space.\\
CPR09 \& CPR18 & Question & What does ``reset'' mean here? \\
CPR10 & Other & This requirement is ambiguous: can he save by drawing or can he save a drawing? \\
CNR02 \& CNR03 & Other & Maybe you can split-up the browsers, so you can do them individually. \\
CNR07 \& CNR08 \& CNR09 & Other & We cannot ensure that this is ALWAYS the case. Maybe the ``mean/average access time'' is a better term. \\
CNR10 & Other & The sentence ``should be easily extendable'' is ambiguous. Maybe there are more wishes in the Software Engineering sense, such as easily extending mixing patterns, easily extending it for different platforms, easily scaling things (but perhaps with a lower priority). \\

Appendix & Missing & Now, it is not directly clear how the use cases are related; perhaps you could add a Use Case Diagram with a ``precedes'' relation to indicate the preconditions.\\
A.3 & Incorrect & The first step in this use case is that the \applicationname\ gives a response, but now it seems that the application triggers the use case. This seems a bit strange, because it is a use case for users.\\
A.3 \& A.5 & Question & Is the confirmation message in step 7 from A.3 and step 7 from A.5 the exact same confirmation message? You're mixing general descriptions with specific descriptions, try to stick to one of them.\\
