2.3 & Other & Change \emph{documents/code} to \emph{items}, characters like the slash look messy. \\

2.3 & 		Other & 	"..the test reports (chapter 5)." I would replace it with "chapters 1-4" to prevent confusion about incl or excl chapter 5. \\
2.6 & 		Other & 	"Similarly" implies 'all things have to pass as well'. It's not the right word in this context.\\
